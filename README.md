# Public-library


## About this idea

- In fact, this idea came from a news article I read during my college days, which reported that China had opened public libraries in some poor areas and listed a list of screened books, but I felt a little bit regretful that all the books were in Chinese, I don't mean to say that this is a bad behavior, but I would like to bring some books in English to the people in poor areas, including the children, to broaden their horizons more. I would like to bring some English books to people in poor areas, including children, so as to broaden their horizons. So the purpose of this program is to select 100 to 200 English books that are less difficult to read, affordable, and have high ratings, and I hope I can really contribute to the world by donating these books in the future!


## Goals

Our over-arching goal for TidyTuesday is to make learning to work with data easier, by providing real-world datasets.

Our goal for 2023-2024 is to increase usage of #TidyTuesday within classrooms.
We would like to be used in at least 10 courses by September 2024.
If you are using TidyTuesday to teach data-related skills, [please let us know](https://forms.gle/G1Y7doYqRU89m9SE8)!

## How to Participate

- Data is [posted to social media](dataset_announcements.md) every Monday morning. Follow the instructions in the new post for how to download the data.
- [Explore the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about **causation** in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.
- Create a visualization, a model, a [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/), or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.
- [Share your output and the code used to generate it](sharing.md) on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.

## Submitting Datasets

`TidyTuesday` is built around open datasets that are found in the "wild" or submitted as [Issues](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues) on our GitHub.

If you find a dataset that you think would be interesting, you can approach it through two ways:

### Submit the dataset as an Issue

1. Find an interesting dataset  
2. Find a report, blog post, article, etc relevant to the data   
3. Submit the dataset as an [Issue](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues) along with a link to the article (and, ideally, 2 images from the article, with alt text)

### Create an entire TidyTuesday challenge!  

1. Find an interesting dataset  
2. Find a report, blog post, article, etc relevant to the data (or create one yourself!)  
3. Let us know you've found something interesting and are working on it by filing an [Issue](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues) on our GitHub  
4. Provide a link or the raw data and a cleaning script for the data  
5. Write a basic `readme.md` file using a recent `readme.md` as a template. Make sure to give yourself credit!
