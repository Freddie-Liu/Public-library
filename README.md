# Public-library


## About this idea

- In fact, this idea came from a news article I read during my college days, which reported that China had opened public libraries in some poor areas and listed a list of screened books, but I felt a little bit regretful that all the books were in Chinese, I don't mean to say that this is a bad behavior, but I would like to bring some books in English to the people in poor areas, including the children, to broaden their horizons more. I would like to bring some English books to people in poor areas, including children, so as to broaden their horizons. So the purpose of this program is to select 100 to 200 English books that are less difficult to read, affordable, and have high ratings, and I hope I can really contribute to the world by donating these books in the future!


## Goals

Filter the dataset of English-language books for 100 to 200 books that fit the criteria.

## Submitting Datasets

`TidyTuesday` is built around open datasets that are found in the "wild" or submitted as [Issues](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues) on our GitHub.

If you find a dataset that you think would be interesting, you can approach it through two ways:

### Submit the dataset as an Issue

1. Find an interesting dataset  
2. Find a report, blog post, article, etc relevant to the data   
3. Submit the dataset as an [Issue](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues) along with a link to the article (and, ideally, 2 images from the article, with alt text)

### Create an entire TidyTuesday challenge!  

1. Find an interesting dataset  
2. Find a report, blog post, article, etc relevant to the data (or create one yourself!)  
3. Let us know you've found something interesting and are working on it by filing an [Issue](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues) on our GitHub  
4. Provide a link or the raw data and a cleaning script for the data  
5. Write a basic `readme.md` file using a recent `readme.md` as a template. Make sure to give yourself credit!
