# Public-library


## About this idea

- In fact, this idea came from a news article I read during my college days, which reported that China had opened public libraries in some poor areas and listed a list of screened books, but I felt a little bit regretful that all the books were in Chinese, I don't mean to say that this is a bad behavior, but I would like to bring some books in English to the people in poor areas, including the children, to broaden their horizons more. I would like to bring some English books to people in poor areas, including children, so as to broaden their horizons. So the purpose of this program is to select 100 to 200 English books that are less difficult to read, affordable, and have high ratings, and I hope I can really contribute to the world by donating these books in the future!


## Goals

Filter the dataset of English-language books for 100 to 200 books that fit the criteria.

## Apologize

This is my first time to use and upload the file to Github, may be due to the use of the lack of proficiency and lead to some problems, I hope that both students or teachers to find problems in the program can be kindly pointed out, I will be seriously modified and hope to be able to share and exchange with more people to write the program experience. Many thanks.
